DataArt Icon Font is an icon set being developed by DataArt inc.'s design team. It's licensed under GNU General Public License v3.0, and that means you may use it on your website, mobile app or anywhere without any references to the authors.

One of the key benefits of our font is it's domain specificness - we divided all the glyphs into domain-specific categories.

You may install the font and copy-and-paste symbols from it into your favourite graphics/interface editor; or you may use SVG files, which are available in the distrubutive.
